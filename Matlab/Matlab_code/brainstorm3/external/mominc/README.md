mominc
======

MOMinc is a small set of functions to read/write MINC files in Matlab and Octave. MINC stands for Medical Image NetCDF. It actually comes in two flavors: MINC1 (based on NetCDF), and MINC2 (based on HDF5). See the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC](MINC documentation) for more info. 

The plan is that both MINC1 and MINC2 will be supported for Matlab and Octave. Currently the reader if functional in Matlab, but has not been tested enough to be considered robust. The writer and the support for Octave are a work in progress.
